## What Is Cash App?
Cash App, created by Square Inc., is a mobile payment service that allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app. Cash App is available on both iOS and Android devices, making it accessible to millions of users globally. Initially launched in 2013 as “Square Cash,” it was rebranded as Cash App in 2015. Over the years, Cash App has grown rapidly, introducing new features that go beyond just money transfers, including the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin, invest in stocks, and even get a free debit card.
How Does Cash App Work?
At its core, Cash App functions similarly to other P2P payment platforms like Venmo or PayPal. The basic process involves linking a bank account, debit card, or credit card to the app, after which users can send or receive money. Here’s how it works:

Download the App: First, download Cash App from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
Create an Account: Sign up with your email, phone number, or a linked social media account.
Link Your Bank Account: To send and receive money, link your bank account or debit card to Cash App. You can also opt for a direct deposit for your paycheck.
Send and Receive Money: After setting up your account, you can send money to anyone who also uses Cash App. Simply input the amount, the recipient’s phone number or email address, and hit “send.” For receiving money, Cash App users will be notified when someone sends money to their account.
Use Cash App Card: Cash App offers a free debit card known as the “Cash Card.” This card can be used for shopping, withdrawing money from ATMs, and more, directly linked to your Cash App balance.
